          The Social Media Distraction
        </h2>
        
        <p style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          Social media platforms are designed to capture and hold our attention. They create endless streams of content that can consume hours of our time, 
          often leaving us feeling drained and unproductive. While these platforms can be valuable for connection and information, they frequently 
          become a barrier to achieving our most important goals.

          Why Focus Matters
        </h2>
        
        <p style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          True success comes from consistent, focused effort toward meaningful objectives. When we lose focus, we scatter our energy across 
          countless distractions, making it nearly impossible to make significant progress in any area of our lives.

          The Power of Intentional Focus
        </h2>
        
        <p style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
          This project serves as a simple reminder: <strong>Stay focused on what truly matters.</strong> It's about remembering where you're going, 
          what you want to achieve, and what you need in your life. It's about not losing sight of your purpose amid the noise of modern life.
